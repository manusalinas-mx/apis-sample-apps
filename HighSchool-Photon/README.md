### New York High Schools App 

Create a native app in Swift with **SwiftUI** components to provide information on NYC High schools.

- Display a list of NYC High Schools (`school_name`, `DBN`)
- Access the JSON API directly from the below link: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2.json
- Selecting a school should show additional information about the school. At the very least, display the `overview_paragraph`
- Please implement using **MVVM** architecture to solve **#1** and **#2**
